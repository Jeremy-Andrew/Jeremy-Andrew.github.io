  <h1>The Jeremy Daily</h1>
  <p>As the citizens of earth continue their grueling indenture to the fly people of Gorgon-V our vigilant reporting on the world of novelty cheese sculptures continues apace</p>
  <p> May Henderson has fashioned a lovely cow out of some cave aged Gruyere. Husband claims he heard it moo!</p>
  <p>Billy Wimbeldon updates us on his struggle to make a calder-style installation out of cottage cheese.</p>
  <p>A terrible death at the hands of the fly people await us all. The innocent take refuge in a God who would never let this happen, the wise in stark madness. Get out, get out while you still can.</p>
